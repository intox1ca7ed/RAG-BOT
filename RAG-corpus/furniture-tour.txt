Furniture Tour is a self-guided trip to China for a profitable purchase of furniture,

Why you should buy furniture in China:
1. A huge selection. Most European furniture manufacturers have moved their
production to China, where you can find products of all categories and tastes
from thousands of furniture companies.
2. High quality. Most of the furniture in China is produced by European companies,
which carefully monitor the quality of their products.
3. Low prices. Buying furniture from a manufacturer in China, even taking into
account all the costs of delivery and customs clearance, will be much cheaper
than in Russia. This is especially advantageous for large-scale purchases, when
you need to furnish a house, a large office, or a restaurant.
4. Accompanying you. Our translation guides will help you navigate the hundreds
of markets and stores, answer your questions, and convey your ideas to the
manufacturer. We will handle all the paperwork.

After placing an order, we will resolve the following issues:
•Collect purchases from all factories in your warehouse
•Check the compliance of the accepted cargo in terms of quality and quantity (confirm with a photo report)
•Prepare the cargo for transportation (packaging)
•Loading the cargo into the container (confirm with a photo report)
•We will issue export documents
