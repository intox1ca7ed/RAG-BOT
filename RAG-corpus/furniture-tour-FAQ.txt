Questions and answers

Should I take my designer on a trip?
Yes, if you have your own competent designer, it is certainly worth
taking him on a trip.
However, he must be a trusted and reliable person, in whom you
do not doubt. In our practice, there have already been many cases
when a designer worked against his client on a trip. This is
especially true when it comes to purchasing finishing materials and
plumbing fixtures. It is no secret that some designers receive
commissions from construction material stores in Russia, and it is
in their best interest for you to purchase as much as possible in
Russia, in the stores they recommend.
In any case, you can listen to their advice, but the final decision is
up to you.

Can I go on a furniture tour without buying anything, just to see if I like it?
Of course, you don't have to buy anything.
We don't sell furniture and we're not a trading intermediary; we
just organize your trip and help you buy furniture in China on your
own.
In our 12 years of experience, we've never had a client who
couldn't find what they needed.
Everyone was satisfied with the selection, quality, and prices of
furniture in China.

How much should you expect to pay for furniture?
The amount you spend depends on many factors:
Your requirements for the quality and price of furniture;the quantity and range of furniture purchased;
etc. Most often, the cost of purchases in a furniture tour is between $50,000 and $100,000.
The size of your purchases has a significant impact on the success
of your trip. The more you purchase during a single trip, the more
profitable it will be, as you will incur fewer overhead expenses
(such as flights, accommodation, transfers, and translators).
In general, a furniture tour is worth planning if you plan to make
purchases worth at least $20,000. In this case, the furniture you
purchase, taking into account all the costs of purchase, delivery,
and customs clearance, becomes cheaper than the alternatives
available on the Russian market.
But even if your amount is small and you won't be able to save
much, China offers a wide range of furniture options to suit every
taste.
You can buy furniture that you won't find in any store in Russia,
and for the same price, you can purchase furniture of higher
quality than what is available in Russia.

Can we clear our container in Russia on our own? 
You can use our customs clearance services or clear your cargo
yourself. We clear cargo in Vladivostok, and you will receive a
cleared cargo. Since we provide a complete set of export
documents for your cargo, you can easily clear your cargo yourself
by contacting your customs broker in your city. We can also
prepare the necessary documents for your cargo if your package
differs from the standard package. However, our standard package
is usually sufficient, and there are no issues with clearance.
Most often, people use our customs clearance services because it's
cheaper and they don't have to spend time on it themselves.

Will the container be mine when it arrives in Russia, or are you sending a groupage shipment?
The container will be yours alone, except in the case when you
yourself find fellow travelers in your city with whom to cooperate
on delivery. For example, one of your acquaintances also wants to
go to China for furniture together with you. Most often, after a
furniture tour, the container is filled completely, because it is in
your interests to buy as much furniture as possible in one trip: the
larger the purchase, the more profitable it is, because the share of
overhead costs is smaller.
Depending on the volume of your purchase, you can also choose
between a 20-foot and a 40-foot container.
How much does it cost to clear a container in China?
The cost of clearing a container is $1,100 per container.
This includes the following expenses:
•container delivery to the loading port;
•processing of export documents;
•port charges in China.

Your website states that the duration of a furniture tour is 7 days. Is it possible to have a longer tour?
The number of days in the tour can be any. You decide how long you want to stay in China.
The faster you buy everything, the faster you will be free.
Our website shows an example of a 7-day standard tour. Most
often, this number of days is sufficient for a furniture tour. No one
wants to spend extra money on accommodation and a translator. If
you wish, we can arrange a vacation program in China after your
furniture tour, including a beach vacation in Hainan.
The duration of your tour may depend on many factors:
•depending on the complexity of your requests;
•from the number of purchased furniture;
•from the place of order processing (at the factory or at the exhibition);
•from the certainty of your wishes (you know exactly what you need or want to see);
•etc.

Can we view furniture at any Chinese factory, or only at the ones you work with?
We have no restrictions on the factories. Of course, you can view
your products at any factory you wish.
We provide you with a translator who is professionally
knowledgeable about furniture and is at your disposal to
accompany you to any factory.
You can choose a factory at the ongoing furniture exhibition in
Foshan, either by selecting it online or based on the
recommendations of your acquaintances.
The only question is time: if you visit factories one by one, you can
visit only 2-3 factories per day, but if you visit the exhibition center
in the city of furniture, where more than 3,000 factories are
represented, you can visit 300-500 factories per day and decide
which factory to visit.
Additionally, our Chinese employees have extensive experience
and can save you time by recommending a suitable factory based
on quality, price, and product range.
We will help you save not only money, but also time.
There were also cases in our practice when clients sent us a
website with photos of the furniture they wanted, and we selected
factories with the right range for them. When they arrived in
China, we took them directly to the desired factory. However, this
is an exclusive service for wealthy clients, so it was not cheap, and
there were only two such cases in our practice. The purchases
were for very large sums.
