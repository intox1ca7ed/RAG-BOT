TRANSIT
Visa-free transit is allowed at Chinese airports for up to 144 hours. You must notify
the airline of your intention to use the visa-free transit right at least three days
before your departure to China. However, even in this case, some Russian airlines
may not allow you to board without a valid visa.
You must have the following documents with you: flight tickets to a third country (in
English), a visa for that country (if the country requires a visa), a boarding pass from
the flight that brought the passenger to China, and a valid foreign passport (at least
3 months).
Visa-free transit through the territory of China is allowed if you need to transfer
from one plane to another within:
- 144 hours, if the transit is carried out through Guangzhou and other cities of
Guangdong Province Shenzhen, Jieyang, Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang
Province, Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province, Shenyang and Liaoning Province,
Chengdu and Chengdu Province Sichuan, Xiamen, Qingdao, Wuhan, Kunming,
Qinhuangdao, Shijiazhuang, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Ningbo, Dalian, Xi'an, Chongqing.
- 72 hours if the flight is via Harbin, Guilin, Changsha.
- 24 hours if the flight is carried out through the airports of Chinese cities with a
short transfer of less than a day. With the exception of Fuzhou Changle
International Airport and Yanji Chaoyangchuan Airport, where visa-free transit is
prohibited, and Urumqi Diwopu International Airport, where the maximum visa-free
transit time is 2 hours.
It is allowed to leave the airport, but you should know that the final decision on
whether you can leave the transit area is made by a border control officer.
In addition to the 72- to 144-hour visa exemption, Chinese regulations allow
international tourists to travel within Shanghai and the provinces of Zhejiang and
Jiangsu (regardless of the city they arrive in), and tourists are also allowed to enter
China through ports and railways (in addition to airports).
Please note: In cities where visa exemption is possible (for 72 hours), international
tourists are allowed to arrive by plane and stay within the city (or province,
depending on the city's policies) where they have landed.

Registration of documents after entering the territory of the People's Republic
of China
After entering the territory of the People's Republic of China, a foreign citizen must
register with the local police department within 24 hours (if they will be staying in a
rented apartment or with friends). There are five types of residence permits: a
residence permit in connection with work in the PRC (for those working on a Z visa
and foreign highly qualified and rare specialists), a residence permit in connection
with studying in the PRC (for holders of a long-term study visa X1), a residencepermit for journalists (with a J1 visa), a permit for family reunification residence
permit (for Q1 visa holders), personal residence permit (for S1 visa holders:
dependents of foreign citizens who are in the PRC for work or study, and persons
who need to stay in the PRC for more than 180 days for other personal reasons).

Illegal residence in the PRC is considered to be:
•staying in the PRC beyond the visa-related stay period or the residence period
specified in the residence documents;
•staying in the PRC after the expiration of the visa-free stay period during a visafree exchange, if the foreign citizen has not obtained documents for further stay
or residence in China;
•leaving the place of residence if it is restricted;
•engaging in activities that are not covered by the purpose of obtaining a visa (for
example, working while in China on a tourist visa).
A foreign citizen who is illegally residing in China may be deported.
